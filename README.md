## ðŸ“Š Project Summary

This project focuses on predicting student performance using the MathE educational dataset, consisting of 9,546 records collected from students across 8 countries.

- Addressed severe class imbalance using **SMOTE**, significantly improving class-wise prediction reliability.
- Developed and evaluated multiple models: **Random Forest**, **Gradient Boosting**, **Neural Network**, and a **Stacking Ensemble**.
- Achieved best accuracy of **86.9%** with the Stacking Ensemble after balancing, compared to **70.9% â€“ 74.6%** before applying SMOTE.
- Demonstrated the impact of ensemble machine learning and data balancing in enhancing personalized learning outcomes.
